## Welcome to battle bots!

*What is this?*

A silly idea by some silly students: Making robots and have them beat each other up.

*Neat. How?*

Main idea is to use Arduino to control moving piles of scrap with weapons and have them beat each other up. Yep.

*And waste Arduinos like that?*

Well... Yes. It's for science.

*So what is here in this repository?*

Code base to assist with various things like moving auxillary components, define autonomous behaviour, control interfaces. Stuff like that.

*But... it is empty...*

Right, because we just started! More info and actual work will be published at some time in the future, so stay tuned!
